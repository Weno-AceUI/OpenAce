## Integrating OpenAce into Your ROM
OpenAce is designed to be easily integrated into custom ROMs. ROM developers do **not** need to clone the entire OpenAce repository. Instead, you only need to integrate the in-development OpenAce API into your ROM project to extend, customize, and interact with the OS at various levels.

### Steps to Integrate OpenAce
1. **Integrate the OpenAce API**
   - Add the OpenAce API (currently in development) as a dependency in your ROM project. Refer to the `docs/` directory for the latest API updates and integration instructions.
2. **Configure Device Support**
   - Add your device configuration under the `device/` directory. Use `device/weno/` as a reference.
3. **Build OpenAce**
   - Use the scripts in the `build/` directory to compile OpenAce for your target hardware.
4. **Integrate AceUI**
   - AceUI is the default UI layer. Customize it in the `ui/` directory to match your ROM's branding and features.
5. **Use the OpenAce API**
   - The OpenAce API will provide hooks and interfaces for ROM-level customization, system service integration, and hardware abstraction. Refer to the `docs/` directory for API updates and usage examples as development progresses.

> **Note:** The OpenAce API is under active development. Stay tuned for updates and detailed integration guides in future releases.

## Getting Started
1. **Build OpenAce**
   - Follow the instructions in the `build/` directory to compile the OS for your target device.
2. **Device Integration**
   - Configure your device in the `device/` directory. Reference examples under `device/weno/`.
3. **Boot Process**
   - The bootloader and kernel sources are in `kernel/`. See `arch/aarch64/` for ARM64 support.
4. **UI Layer**
   - AceUI is the default user interface. Customize it in the `ui/` directory.
